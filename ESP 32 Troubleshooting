Currently the Arduino IDE V1.8.8 causes problems writing the EEprom of the ESP.
Please use 1.8.7 instead, until i find a solution.


The ESP32 enhancement of the arduino IDE works since 2019 JAN.04 with both Ways:

The easy version with the boardmanager:

and also with the tricky version over gitgui:

OLED LIBRARY:
You can find the used SSD1306 in the LibraryManager of the Arduino IDE, it's called:
ESP8266 and ESP32 Oled Driver for SSD1306 display by Daniel Eichhorn, Fabrice Weinberg

GOOD LUCK
